# Python Youtube Downloader
## Overview:
This project is born out of the fact that I don't trust sketchy websites and because I tend to procrastinate actually downloading the stuff I want. In turn I get a huge list of stuff I should download but just haven't, so I created this program to do it all for me. 
## Running the project: 
### Dependencies:
All you need to do is make sure you have python3 installed along with the moviepy, tqdm, and pytube modules. If you don't know how to install any of those things there are plenty of guides on the internet. 
### Setup:
Go into the `setup.json` and for `"video_dir"` replace `x` with the full path of the folder you would like the videos to be saved in. Do the same for the `"music_dir"` variable with the full path of the folder you would liek the music to be saved in. In your music folder create a simple *.txt* file named `videos.txt`. In the `videos.txt` file put in all the urls of the videos you would like to be downloaded, **one url per line**. 
### Running the program:
This should also be pretty straightforward. If you don't know how to run a python file, search it up.
